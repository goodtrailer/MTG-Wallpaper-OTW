# MTG-Wallpaper-OTW

MTG Wallpaper OTW grabs new weekly Magic: The Gathering wallpaper from the official Magic: The Gathering website (Magic: The Gathering is NOT owned by me, it is a trademark of Wizards of the Coast LLC).
The website: https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/media/wallpapers

# Installation:
Run the .msi from the Releases page. Install wherever you'd like. To uninstall, you can just use the Control Panel like any other program.

# Usage:
The program will run everyday at midnight (or if it misses midnight, the next time you boot your PC) and check for new wallpaper. If there is new wallpaper (which usually happens every week), then it downloads the image, overwriting the previous image, and sets it as your desktop wallpaper.
