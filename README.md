# MTG-Wallpaper-OTW
THIS PROGRAM IS WINDOWS ONLY! <br />
MTG Wallpaper OTW grabs new weekly Magic: The Gathering wallpaper from the official Magic: The Gathering website and sets it as your Windows desktop wallpaper.<br />
<b>Magic: The Gathering a trademark of Wizards of the Coast LLC.</b><br/>
The website: https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/media/wallpapers

# Installation:
Run the .msi from the <a href="https://github.com/goodtrailer/MTG-Wallpaper-OTW/releases">releases</a> page. Install wherever you'd like. To uninstall, you can just use the Control Panel like any other program.

# Usage:
The program will run automatically everyday at midnight (or if it misses midnight, the next time you boot your PC). Previous wallpaper will be overwritten to prevent bloating.
