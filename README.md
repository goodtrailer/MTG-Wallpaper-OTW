<b>OBSOLETE: MTG Wallpaper OTW is obsolete. Check out the new, modular [goodtrailer/daily-desktop](https://github.com/goodtrailer/daily-desktop).</b>

THIS PROGRAM IS WINDOWS ONLY!

MTG Wallpaper OTW grabs new weekly Magic: The Gathering wallpaper from the official Magic: The Gathering website and sets it as your Windows desktop wallpaper.<br />
<br/>
The website: https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/media/wallpapers

# Installation:
Run the .msi from the <a href="https://github.com/goodtrailer/MTG-Wallpaper-OTW/releases">releases</a> page. <b>NOTE:</b> When running the .msi file, you may get a "Windows protected your PC". <b>This program is open-source, so if you don't trust the program, you can check the code if you want.</b> Click "More info" and then "Run anyway" if you end up trusting the program. To uninstall, you can just use the Control Panel like any other program.

# Usage:
The program will run automatically everyday at midnight (or if it misses midnight, the next time you boot your PC). Previous wallpaper will be overwritten to prevent bloating.
